# weather service

This is the test for frontend developers. The test for backend developers is [here](https://github.com/SuperCarers/weather-service-backend)

Please do not push your solution to a publicly available repo.

# Introduction

The end user would like to visualise the Heathrow weather station information
on a graph. The `heathrow-weatherstation.json` file contains the information on
temperature max/min, rain fall in mm and sunshine hours. This information
starts Jan 1958 and ends Dec 2014.

![Layout](https://github.com/SuperCarers/weather-service-frontend/blob/master/layout.png?raw=true)

The sketch above shows the layout and controls the end user would like in a web
browser. The end user will select one of the fields temp max/min, rainfall or
sunshine hours. The end user will enter a start and end range for the graph.
The start and end will be the year & month. When the user presses "Display" the
graph is generated.

The layout should be centrally located vertically and horizontally and should
render in all major browsers. The end user will also use this on their phone
and tablet. The layout should be responsive and find the best way to layout the
graph and controls in the available space.

# Deliverable

Please implement this specification using React. Please feel free to use
whatever graphing library you want. Please also implement some styling to make
the application look good, but don't feel like you need to send ages styling
it. We'll also be looking for some unit tests, but again, don't feel like you
need to spend a long time on them.

A private repository or archive containing source code with build instructions.
